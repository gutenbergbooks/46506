                             ANNOUNCEMENTS


THE COMPLETE WORKS OF CHARLES LAMB. Edited by E. V. Lucas. With numerous
Illustrations. _In Seven Volumes. Demy 8vo. 7s. 6d. each._

  This new edition of the works of Charles and Mary Lamb, in five
  volumes (to be followed by two volumes containing the Letters), will
  be found to contain a large quantity of new matter both in prose and
  verse—several thousand words in all. Mr. E. V. Lucas, the editor, has
  attempted in the notes, not only to relate Lamb’s writings to his
  life, but to account for all his quotations and allusions—an ideal of
  thoroughness far superior to any that previous editors have set before
  themselves. A Life of Lamb by Mr. Lucas will follow next year.

THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF OLIVER CROMWELL. By Thomas Carlyle. With an
Introduction by C. H. Firth, M.A., and Notes and Appendices by Mrs. S.

                                          [_Methuen’s Standard Library._

  This edition is brought up to the standard of modern scholarship by
  the addition of numerous new letters of Cromwell, and by the
  correction of many errors which recent research has discovered.

BARABBAS: A DREAM OF THE WORLD’S TRAGEDY. _Thirty-Eighth Edition._

  ‘The tender reverence of the treatment and the imaginative beauty of
  the writing have reconciled us to the daring of the conception. This
  “Dream of the World’s Tragedy” is a lofty and not inadequate
  paraphrase of the supreme climax of the inspired narrative.’—_Dublin
  Review._

THE SORROWS OF SATAN. _Forty-Sixth Edition._

  ‘A very powerful piece of work.... The conception is magnificent, and
  is likely to win an abiding place within the memory of man.... The
  author has immense command of language, and a limitless audacity....
  This interesting and remarkable romance will live long after much of
  the ephemeral literature of the day is forgotten.... A literary
  phenomenon ... novel, and even sublime.’—W. T. Stead in the _Review of
  Reviews_.

THE MASTER CHRISTIAN.

                                                      [_165th Thousand._

  ‘It cannot be denied that “The Master Christian” is a powerful book;
  that it is one likely to raise uncomfortable questions in all but the
  most self-satisfied readers, and that it strikes at the root of the
  failure of the Churches—the decay of faith—in a manner which shows the
  inevitable disaster heaping up.... The good Cardinal Bonpré is a
  beautiful figure, fit to stand beside the good Bishop in “Les
  Misérables.” It is a book with a serious purpose expressed with
  absolute unconventionality and passion.... And this is to say it is a
  book worth reading.’—_Examiner._

  ‘It is a perfectly enchanting story of love and chivalry, and pure

THE HISTORY OF SIR RICHARD CALMADY. _Seventh Edition._ A Limited Edition

  ‘A picture finely and amply conceived. In the strength and insight in

  reflection bestowed upon its execution, and in the moving sincerity of
  its pathos throughout, “Sir Richard Calmady” must rank as the great
  novel of a great writer.’—_Literature._
